# danger-noodle
A fork of the [Boa](http://www.boa.org) version 0.94.13 webserver with light security enhancements.

### About
Boa was created in 1991 by [Paul Phillips](paulp@go2net.com). It was maintained and enhanced by [Larry Doolittle](ldoolitt@boa.org) and [Jon Nelson](jnelson@boa.org) until about 2005. It is a performant single-threaded webserver that has found favor in the embedded Linux + IoT communities for its light footprint, ease of compilation, and adaptibility.

### Goals
This repository does not:
* Fix any latent bugs in the Boa webserver (though I would consider accepting a PR for that)
* Provide any documents on building or running the Boa webserver
* Aim to revitalize or otherwise support development of the Boa webserver
* Aim to develop new features on or otherwise extend the Boa webserver, a la [Hydra](http://hydra.hellug.gr/)
* Lead to a maintainer who could provide commercial support for the Boa webserver

This repository does:
* Provide the source code for the Boa 0.94.13 webserver with light security enhancements
* Really, nothing else
